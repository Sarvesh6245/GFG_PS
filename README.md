# GeeksforGeeks DSA Problem Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from GeeksforGeeks (GFG). This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to understand and improve their problem-solving skills in DSA.

## About

This repository is organized by the level of difficulty, and each problem is accompanied by its solution, implemented in the programming language of my choice. The solutions are intended to be clear, efficient, and well-documented to help others understand the thought process and logic behind them.

## Repository Structure

The problems are categorized into the following levels of difficulty:

- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems that help to build a strong foundation in DSA.
- **Medium**: Intermediate problems that require a good understanding of DSA concepts.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems that challenge your problem-solving skills and understanding of complex algorithms.

Each level of difficulty is organized into separate folders, with each folder containing the solutions to the problems within that difficulty category.

## Getting Started

To browse through the solutions, simply navigate to the folder corresponding to the difficulty level youâ€™re interested in:

- [Easy](./Easy)
- [Medium](./Medium)
- [Hard](./Hard)

Each solution is provided as a 'Java' .
